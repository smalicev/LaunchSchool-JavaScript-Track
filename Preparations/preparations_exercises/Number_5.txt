Identify the Constructors for each of the following methods and classify each method as either a "Static" or a "Prototype" method:

    substring   --- String, prototype
    create      --- Object, static
    fromCharCode --- String, static
    slice --- String, prototype
    toString --- Object, date,array, prototype

It might be that more than one constructor provides a method with a given name. Make sure you list them all in your answer. 
You can limit your search for methods to the String, Object, Array, and Number constructors.
